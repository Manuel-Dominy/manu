                My Dearest Visk,
            </h3>
            <p>
                Every time I close my eyes, it’s your smile I see — soft, comforting, and brighter than the morning sun sneaking through the curtains. Just like a pillow that cradles me after a long day, your love wraps around me, soothing every ache, calming every storm.

Visk, you are my favorite place to rest — not just my head, but my heart too.

I never thought someone could be my peace and my passion all at once. But you are. When I hold you close, it’s like lying on the softest pillow, knowing that in this world of chaos, there is a perfect, quiet corner where I truly belong — with you.

I want to be your comfort too. The arms you fall into when you’re tired, the voice that lulls you into peace, the pillow you hug when the world feels too heavy. I want to be there — always — like your favorite pillow you never want to let go of.

I fall for you a little more every time you laugh, every time you call me with that sparkle in your voice, and even in those quiet, sleepy moments when we just exist — breathing the same air, hearts in sync, no words needed.

Visk, my love, you are my soft place to land, my dream woven in cotton and warmth, my forever comfort.

With all the love in my heart (and all the fluff of a thousand pillows),

            </p>
            <h3>Yours, always,<br>Manu</h3>

                <p>Those moments were more than moments.
They were magnets, pulling me closer to you without warning.
The way you spoke… the way you listened…
The spark in your eyes when you smiled—
It wasn’t love yet,
But it was the soft beginning of everything.
